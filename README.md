# Ableton Music GPT Plugin (by Dr. Tristan Behrens)

Thanks a lot for your interest in bridging the gap between Generative AI for music and Ableton Live! This release includes a very early prototype of an Ableton plugin (device). The fact you are reading this makes me super happy, because it shows that you are supporting my work. Thanks a lot!


## Installation and how-to

Here are videos that will get you started: 

- Third release: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1I_cDz9ZEI (new!)
- Second release: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGk_atla6Gc
- First release: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGk_atla6Gc
- Entire playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOy6DpeZb6LH3m58PIe8XPlzpqHuCkIuy&si=8aoASYW9mOmOodLj

You need an API token in order to run the plugin.


## Releases

### Release 3 (this one)

- I have added some stabilizations.
- New feature: Use Ableton's scale mode to restrict the notes that are being generated. Note that this only enforces the notes, not the scale. Remember that A minor and C major have the same notes.

### Release 2

- Due to popular demand you can generate MIDI files when using the Python API. Note this does not concern the Ableton functionality. The notebook shows how.
- There is a new button "Fill Up". Here you just have to enable some tracks for AI composition via the Toggle button and define a loop region. Fill up will will up empty spaces using a simple inpainting approach.
- Setting the density. There is now a slider that allows you to specify how many notes are being generated.
- The window is now always on top.

### Release 1

- The first release only had minimal functionality.


## Important things at the beginning

In its current manifestation, the tool works as a client-server app. The server is hosted by me on my own hardware. You computer will run the plugin. Of course, you need to be connected to the internet to be able to compose. Also I will collect usage data to improve the creative experience. Note that the data I will collect will not be released to the public.

Also, by using this prototype you aggree that I will not be responsible if something goes wrong. Of course this is very unlikely, but I want you to be aware that this is a prototype, and that things might go wrong.


## Submitting issues and feature requests.

Feel free to reach out to me if you run into any issues. And of course do not hesitate to share feature requests. I am very eager to improve the experience and every comment will be useful.


## Known issues and plan

Things that I am already aware of:

- The user interface is not the most beautiful. As always: "content before chrome". Things will get nicer looking once the basic functionality is there.
- The AI models are only available via the API. So far there are no plans to release the models. However, I am considering releasing composing applications that you can run on your computer without the need for an API.
- Chord conditioning is in the pipeline. It is very likely that I will release a version that allows you to specify a chord progression, and the AI will compose multiple tracks following that chord progression.
- There might be some performance issues when you use the plugin longer. I suspect Ableton's undo functionality to contribute to this.


## Non Disclosure?

Feel free to talk about this plugin whenever you like, including posts on social media. Preferably positive ones ðŸ¤— Please do not share your API token.
