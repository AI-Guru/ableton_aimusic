# Ableton Music GPT Plugin

Thanks a lot for you interest in bridging the gap between Generative AI for music and Ableton Live! This release includes a very early prototype. That you are reading this makes me super happy, because it shows that you are supporting my work. Thanks a lot!


## Important things at the beginning

In its current manifestation, the tool works as a client-server scenario. The server is hosted by me on my own hardware. Thus you need to be connected to the internet to be able to compose. Also I will collect usage data to improve the creative experience. Note that the data I will collect will not be released to the public.

Also, by using this prototype you aggree that I will not be responsible if something goes wrong. Of course this is very unlikely, but I want you to be aware that this is a prototype, and that things might go wrong.

## What you get so far

## Known issues and plan

Things that I am already aware of:

- The AI models are only available via the API. So far there are no plans to release the models. However, I am considering releasing composing applications that you can run on your computer without the need for an API.
- Chord conditioning is in the pipeline. It is very likely that I will release a version that allows you to specify a chord progression, and the AI will compose multiple tracks following that chord progression.
- The current prototype only works with 4 bars at a time. Everything else is very likely to cause trouble. Future versions will make it possible to work with music that is shorter and longer.
- Inpainting - I mean: filling in missing bars - is not supported yet. It is planned for a future release.
